# Datica CLI

Welcome to the Datica CLI.

## Documentation

To learn more about the Datica CLI and all the great features we've added, we recommend reading the [documentation](https://help.datica.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005672426).

Check out the [releases](https://github.com/daticahealth/cli/releases) page or check below to download the right version for your platform.

## Automatic Updates

Once downloaded, the CLI will automatically update itself when a new version becomes available. However you can always check out the latest release [here](https://github.com/daticahealth/cli/releases).

**PLEASE NOTE** You **must** put the CLI binary in a location for which you have write permissions. Without write permissions, the CLI will not automatically update and you will have to update manually by visiting the github repo and downloading the latest binary.
